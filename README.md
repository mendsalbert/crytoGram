CryptoGram is a DDap version of instagram that runs on a blockchain network. User will be able to recieve cryptos on their posts.

React, Tailwind css , Truffle , Ganache , web3 js , solidity and meta mask were some of the technologies used for this project. Truffle and Ganache were the tools used to simulate a real blockchain network locally for development. web3 js is the framework used to interact the smart contracts built with solidity in the front end.

In my future update, I hope to the following features.

- Follow other users on the network
- Tips on stories
- Search other users on the network
- comments on post
